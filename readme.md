This application is currently being built to support a text-based user interface. 
In the future, GUI functionality will replace it.

This application utilizes two API's: 
  - The first API responds with a JSON containing the currency codes for all currencies that are currently in use globally
  - The second API responds with a JSON containing a specific conversion value given two currencies
